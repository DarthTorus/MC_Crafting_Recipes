# MC Crafting Recipes
All the crafting recipes I have created for Minecraft 1.13+

If you have any suggestions, add them as an issue and mark them as `suggestion`

1. Download  `darth` and place it into the `%appdata%/.minecraft/saves/<Name of world save>/datapacks` folder you want to have the recipes in.
***NOTE** This must be in the new Minecraft snapshots or later (`17w48a+`).*
1. If it is a zip file, just unzip it.
